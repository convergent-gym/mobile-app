# Swole Control Mobile

This is a mobile app for Swole Control which allows end-users to see the avalibility of machines in a gym in real time. It is built using
React Native and Typescript. In order to show a live map of the gym, we wrote our own library for showing interactive maps with clickable
entities that has great performance. 

It currently queries our Firestore database directly in order to provide enhanced speed and utilize. In the future,
it would be possible to connect the mobile app to our API in order to provide more features to our end users and so we have a better defined
application boundary.
